# flexible-lane-direction-intersection

Unsignalized intersection cooperation has been be proved to be able to eliminate green time loss of signalized intersections and improve traffic efficiency. Most of the existing research about unsignalized intersection cooperation considers fixed lane turning, where only specific turning behavior of vehicles is allowed on each lane. Given that traffic volume abd the proportion of vehicles with different turning expectation may change with time, fixed lane turning may lead to inefficiency at intersetions. This paper proposes a multi-lane unsignalized intersection cooperation method that considers variable lane turning. The two-dimensional distribution of vehicles is calculated and vehicles that are not in conflict are scheduled to pass the intersection simultaneously. The formation reconfiguration method is utilized to achieve collision-free longitudinal and lateral position adjustment of vehicles. Simulations are conducted at different input traffic volumes and turning proportion of in-coming vehicles, and the results indicate that our method outperformances the fixed-lane-turning unsignalized cooperation method and the signalized method.
